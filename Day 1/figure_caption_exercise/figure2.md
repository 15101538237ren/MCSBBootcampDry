Figure 2:  controls
16
of 16
in the 16 system.
In panel A, we show the response of 16
, in units of 16
/16,
as 16 increases.
Several values of 16 are shown.
Using 16
allows us to infer 16
from observations of 16
in 16.
In panel B, we compare the resulting estimations of 16
in units of 16.
Data are shown for two conditions, 16 and 16.
Overlaid curves are best fits of the 16 model
and the 16 model.
