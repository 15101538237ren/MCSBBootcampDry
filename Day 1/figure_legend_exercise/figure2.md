Figure 2: ??? controls
??? of
??? in the
??? system.
In panel A, we show the response of ??? as
??? increases, for several conditions of
???. Using
??? allows us to infer
??? from observations of
??? in ???.
In panel B, we compare the resulting values of
??? for
??? under two conditions,
??? and ???.
Overlaid curves are best fits of the
??? model and the
??? model.
